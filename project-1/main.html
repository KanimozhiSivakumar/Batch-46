    <P>The Executive General Management Programme
         (EGMP) is a part-time certificate programme
          designed for functional managers aspiring 
          to move into a general management role and 
          fast-track managers who have recently moved
           into a general management role, to develop
            core business skills and competencies, 
            which would equip them to handle issues
             involving cross-functional areas.
